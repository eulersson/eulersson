# Hey, I'm Ramon 👋

[![Typing SVG](https://readme-typing-svg.demolab.com?font=Fira+Code&pause=1000&multiline=true&width=435&separator=%3C&lines=from+code+to+deployment;%3Cfrom+back+to+front;)](https://www.ramn.dev)


I’m a software engineer with over a decade of experience building things that run reliably, scale well, and solve real problems.

In the past, I’ve helped real time and live video-related SaaS platforms scale to thousands of users, built internal tools for Disney’s Lion King 🦁 VFX workflows, and delivered secure systems for banks and governments. I care about thoughtful architecture, writing maintainable code, and finding that sweet spot between over-engineering and tech debt.

These days, I enjoy working across the stack — from real-time APIs in Go or Python to clean UIs in React or Next.js, and from DevOps pipelines to data wrangling scripts. I’ve also spent a good amount of time around WebRTC, serverless systems, observability, and cost optimization.

## 🧩 Things I often do

- Design APIs and backend systems (REST/gRPC)
- Build frontend UIs and dashboards
- Architect real-time apps (WebSockets, WebRTC)
- Write CI/CD pipelines, containerize, deploy
- Automate stuff (scraping, data pipelines, ML serving)
- Refactor, migrate, debug — all the fun stuff

## 🧰 Tools I reach for
**Languages & Frameworks:** Python, Go, C++, Django, FastAPI, Flask, React, Angular  
**Infra & DevOps:** Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, CloudFormation, Ansible  
**DBs & Queues:** PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, Celery  
**Other areas:** WebGL, TensorFlow, OpenGL, Neo4j, SAML/OAuth/OpenID
