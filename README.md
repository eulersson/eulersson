# Hey, I'm Ramon 👋

I’m a software engineer with over a decade of experience building things that run reliably, scale well, and solve real problems.

In the past, I’ve helped SaaS platforms scale to thousands of users, built internal tools for Disney’s Lion King 🦁 VFX workflows, and delivered secure systems for banks and governments. I care about thoughtful architecture, writing maintainable code, and finding that sweet spot between over-engineering and tech debt.

These days, I enjoy working across the stack — from real-time APIs in Go or Python to clean UIs in React or Next.js, and from DevOps pipelines to data wrangling scripts. I’ve also spent a good amount of time around WebRTC, serverless systems, observability, and cost optimization.

## 🧩 Things I often do
- Design APIs and backend systems (REST/gRPC)
- Build frontend UIs and dashboards
- Architect real-time apps (WebSockets, WebRTC)
- Write CI/CD pipelines, containerize, deploy
- Automate stuff (scraping, data pipelines, ML serving)
- Refactor, migrate, debug — all the fun stuff

## 🧰 Tools I reach for
**Languages & Frameworks:** Python, Go, C++, Django, FastAPI, Flask, React, Angular  
**Infra & DevOps:** Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, CloudFormation, Ansible  
**DBs & Queues:** PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, Celery  
**Other areas:** WebGL, TensorFlow, OpenGL, Neo4j, SAML/OAuth/OpenID
